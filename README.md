block_misspelled_websites
=========================

chrome extension

Blocks a website if the url is similar to one on a whitelist.

Some phishing sites trick an individual to giving their details by having a url which is almost as the same as the real site. The website address may differ by a single letter or have transposed characters.

This extension aims to block domains which have similar spelling to those on a whitelist, whilst allowing the websites on the whitelist to pass through and also allowing websites not on the whitelist. If you try to go to a website which is very similar to the one on the whitelist, then this extension will block it.

The domains on the whitelist are:

steamcommunity.com

sourceop.com

youtube.com

tf2outpost.com

Currently this extension is in test stage so it is not possible to modify the domains on the whitelist.
